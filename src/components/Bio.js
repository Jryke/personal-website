				<h4>work smarter... and harder</h4>
				<p>
					I consider myself to be intelligent, but I also know that intelligence is useless without applying it.  In my professional life (as well as anything that I do), I am a hard worker and I always strive to give my 100% in everything that I do.  I hold to the proverb "any job worth doing is a job worth doing well".  If I am going to put my time and energy into something, I am going to see it through properly; otherwise I am just wasting my time and energy.  Therfore, I take pride in everything I do and I do everything to the best of my ability.

				<h4>Create and be creative:</h4>
				<p>
					Growing up, my father was a carpenter and an architect so we had a woodshop in the basement of our house.  I spent a lot of my childhood in the basement making things (including my own toys or boxes to store my toys).  Among other expriences, I believe that this largely shaped my desire to be creative and build things.  I get a lot of satisfaction out of planning a project, executing it and seeing the desired result in the end.  This has played a big part for me becoming a web developer.  I really enjoy the creative process of building web sites and web apps from the beginning to the end.  I read a quote recently that really got my attention: "Be a creator, not a consumer".  Every day people are consuming more information and entertainment online; I want to be a part of creating it, not only consuming it.

				<h4>Be a lifelong learner:</h4>
				<p>
					I love to learn and I know that learning is the best use of my time.  I believe that if I am not learning (and enjoying what I am learning), I am wasting my time.  While studying my masters degree in Applied Linguistics to become a teacher, I learned not just how to be a good teacher but also to be a good student.

				<h4>Do what you love and love what you do:</h4>
				<p>
					Time is the most valuable thing that we have and we need to take advantage of it as much as possible to be happy.  To take advantage of our time, it is important to work doing something that you love to do, otherwise you are wasting your time doing things that don't contribute to your happiness.  Many people work to make money but don't have the time to enjoy it, this is counter-intuitive.  Enjoying what you do is the key a "successful" lifestyle, not just making money (although money is nice to have too!).

				<h4>Travel</h4>

				<h4>Music</h4>
				<p>I love listening to music.  I am a music collector.  My love for music goes hand-in-hand with my love for travelling.  I have an extensive collection of music that I grew up with and music that I have acquired while travelling.  I play guitar and DJ.  While living in Colombia for 4 years, I became immersed in the local Champeta music, which is a Colombian/Afro-Caribbean music that is hard not to like.</p>
				<h4>Languages</h4>
				<p>I grew up speaking English and after finishing my undergraduate degree, I decided it was time to learn Spanish.  I am fluent in Spanish and I have learned some Portuguese.  I have since learned JavaScript which although not a human language, was still learning another language.  While learning JavaScript, I found that computer languages are more similar to human languages than I had thought.</p>
